HOW TO PLAY:
FOR SINGLEPLAYER (AGAINST A CPU OPPONENT)
Select any options you would like for single player game mode, then hit the 
"Single Player" button

FOR MULTIPLAYER:
(launch the AliensServer.java from acad)
Hitting the multiplayer button will send you to a multiplayer lobby screen.
If you are the first to arrive, you will be assigned the role of Ripley. Once at
least 1 other player arrives, you will have the option to start the game. You may
wish to wait for other players to arrive. Clicking "Start" will launch the game
for all players connected.

IN THE GAME SCREEN:
SINGLEPLAYER:
When racko starts, it is your turn, so simply decide which pile you would like to
draw from by clicking on that pile, and then to perform a swap with your rack you
simply click on the card you would like to swap out, or click the discard pile if 
you would rather discard it. The turn will then go to the AI, when it is 
finsihed, control will go back to you! Have fun!

MULTIPLAYER:
The turn counter alien keeps track of whose turn it is. When it is above your rack,
it is your turn. Click on the main or discard pile to draw a card, then click a 
position on your rack to swap with that card, or click on the discard pile to 
discard it. The first player to have an ordered rack wins!


TO ACCESS THE CHEAT MENU:
click inside the Alien's INNER mouth on the START SCREEN to activate the cheat
panel, inside you will find options for the various cheat modes. The cheats below
the MULTIPLAYER COMPATIBLE line will work in multiplayer AND singleplayer modes
